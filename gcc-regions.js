// gcc-regions.js v0.3.0 — 2026-04-25
// World of Greyhawk region boundaries, current-grid coordinate frame.
//
// Two formats per region, lookup precedence hex-tags (across all
// regions) → polygon vertices:
//   { name, hexes: ["P4-85", ...] }   // explicit hex membership (primary)
//   { name, vertices: [...] }         // closed polygon (secondary)
//
// Hex-set entries and polygon vertices may be Darlene IDs ("P4-85") OR
// [col,row] pairs. Point-in-polygon uses canonical unit-space hex centers.
//
// v0.3.0: rectangle regions removed. BASE entries now only carry
//   name/kind/color/anchors — geometry comes from painted hex sets.
//   Rects were a pre-hex-set placeholder and produced misclassification
//   on a hex grid (a bbox in (col,row) doesn't trace a country's border).
//   Bootstrap-from-landmarks + paint is the authoritative workflow now.
//   Empty BASE regions sit in the picker waiting to be painted; QA
//   is meaningful once Bootstrap has run. setRegionMeta no longer
//   accepts suppressRect.
//
// v0.2.0: hex-set membership format and editor API.
//   - GH_REGIONS entries can carry `hexes` (preferred) or `vertices`.
//   - localStorage overrides: new regions, hex membership edits, color
//     and kind updates. Layered like gcc-terrain / gcc-landmarks.
//   - addRegion / removeRegion / addHexes / removeHexes / setHexes /
//     erasePaintAt / clearHexes / fillFromPolygon /
//     bootstrapFromLandmarks / exportOverrides / clearOverrides /
//     exportMergedSource.
//   - getMembership() returns { name, source } where source is
//     'hexes' | 'vertices' — lets the editor distinguish
//     painted hexes from polygon fallback.
//   - Each region carries a `color` for editor overlay rendering;
//     defaulted by hash of name when not provided.
//
// v0.1.0: polygon + rect dual support, point-in-polygon over unit-space
//   hex centers, lazy polygon resolution, QA harness.

  // ── REGION DATA ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  // BASE: file-baked region definitions. Just curated metadata —
  // name, kind, color, capital, and anchor landmarks for QA.
  // Geometry comes from painted hex sets (Bootstrap / Outline editor).
  //
  // Coverage: Flanaess polities at 1983 canonical baseline. Matches
  // Darlene-map era naming. Post-Wars (569 CY) state for things like
  // Iuz absorbing the Horned Society, Shield Lands occupation, etc.
  // is deferred — when it lands it will layer on top via overrides.
  //
  // Naming convention: formal title where the polity has one in its
  // LGG entry heading (Kingdom of Keoland, Archbarony of Ratik, See
  // of Medegia, etc.); bare name otherwise (Wild Coast, Bandit
  // Kingdoms, Sea Princes — territories without a formal title).
  //
  // Capital field is bibliographic (which city is the seat of
  // government); editor consumers can use it as a reminder when
  // tagging a city landmark with `region:` so the capital actually
  // sits inside its own region's painted hexes.
  //
  // Order is no longer load-bearing — the two-pass lookup (hex-tags
  // first across all regions, then polygon vertices) means inner /
  // outer overlap resolves by which region painted the hex, not by
  // file position. Listed roughly clockwise from Greyhawk City for
  // ease of human scanning.
  // ── REGION DETAILS (1983 boxed-set canon metadata) ───────────────────
  // Keyed by BASE region name. Merged into each region at applyDefs
  // time so consumers can read region.ruler / region.humanPop /
  // region.resources / region.notes etc. Honorific prefixes have
  // been stripped from ruler strings to factual name+title.
  // Population tier per region — drives encounter check frequency.
  // Per DMG p.47 Chance Of Encounter:
  //   dense       1 in 20  ('relatively dense')
  //   patrolled   1 in 12  ('moderate to sparse / patrolled')
  //   uninhabited 1 in 10  ('uninhabited / wilderness')
  //
  // Important caveat: the DMG categories really apply at the area
  // level, not the kingdom level. Most of any kingdom is farmland and
  // light forest with occasional patrols ('patrolled'). Only the
  // immediate vicinity of a city qualifies as 'relatively dense'.
  // Hex-level overrides (or landmark-radius auto-derivation) are the
  // right long-term fix; for now this map is region-default only,
  // with the understanding that 'dense' is reserved for things that
  // really are dense at the 30-mile-hex scale (large cities and
  // their immediate surroundings).
